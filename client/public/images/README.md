# Background Image Setup

To use the hero background image:

1. Copy your `hero-background.png` image file to this directory: `client/public/images/hero-background.png`

2. The image should be a high-quality landscape/travel photo (recommended: 1920x1080 or larger)

3. The CSS is already configured to use this image as the landing page background

4. The image will be displayed with a gradient overlay for better text readability

If the image is not found, the page will fall back to the gradient background.
